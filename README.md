# temp-to-temp
Temperature Conversion App that allows for conversion between 6 scales, written in Javascript using Kinoma Studio. 

The Temp-to-Temp application does exactly what its name suggests: it easily converts a temperature from one of 6 different temperature types into another type. Additionally, it displays the conversion of all 6-scales at the bottom for easy access. Currently, the Temp-to-Temp is capable of conversions between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, Rankine, Delisle, and Newton temperature scales.

<h5>INSTRUCTIONS:</h5>
How to Use the Temp-to-Temp (in 5 easy steps!)
1. Open up the application.
2. Select the desired input temperature using the slider. Check the current temperature with the input temperature display on the top of the middle column, under the blue INPUT letters.
3. Select the desired input scale using the radio buttons on the left of the application – check that the INPUT (SCALE) above the input temperature in the top of the middle column changes to reflect your desired input scale.
(NOTE: The equivalent of your selected temperature will appear in the 6-scale display on the bottom half of the application in all 6 scales for easy reading or if you want multiple conversions at once.)
4. Select the desired output scale using the radio buttons on the right of the application – check that the OUTPUT (SCALE) below the output temperature on the bottom of the middle column changes to reflect your desired output scale.
5. If you want to do more conversions, repeat steps 1-4 until you’re finished with your conversion.
