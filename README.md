# temp-to-temp
Temperature Conversion App that allows for conversion between 6 scales, written in Javascript using Kinoma Studio. 

The Temp-to-Temp application does exactly what its name suggests: it easily converts a temperature from one of 6 different temperature types into another type. Additionally, it displays the conversion of all 6-scales at the bottom for easy access. Currently, the Temp-to-Temp is capable of conversions between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, Rankine, Delisle, and Newton temperature scales.
